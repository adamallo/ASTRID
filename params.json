Then, run distmethods/install.sh. This will install the distance methods that ASTRID supports.\r\n\r\nCurrently, ASTRID supports FastME and PhyD*. \r\n\r\n### FastME\r\nResults presented in the ASTRID paper use FASTME 1, available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Desper/FastME.html, but FASTME 2.0 is now available at http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/fastme/binaries.php, and works with ASTRID as well.\r\n \r\n### PhyD*\r\nPhyD* is available at http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyd/binaries.php. It implements four algorithms: MVR*, BioNJ*, NJ*, and UNJ*. These methods are recommended for incomplete distance matrices.\r\n\r\n## Running ASTRID\r\n\r\nASTRID is run with the following command line arguments:\r\n\r\n    python ASTRID.py [-h] -i INPUT [-o OUTPUT] [-m METHOD] [-c CACHE]\r\n\r\n* METHOD is one of \"auto\", \"bionj\", \"mvr\", \"nj\", \"unj\", or \"fastme\", depending on which method you would like to use. \"auto\" will use FastME when the distance matrix has no missing entries, and BioNJ* if there are missing entries.\r\n* INPUT is a file containing a list of gene trees in newick format.\r\n* OUTPUT will contain the estimated species tree; the species tree will also be output to the standard output\r\n* CACHE is an optional argument specifying a place to save the distance matrix in PHYLIP format. This is useful if you would like to run multiple distance-based methods on the same gene tree set. If this file already exists, ASTRID will skip the matrix generation step and just run the species tree estimation step with the method specified.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
