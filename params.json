{"name":"Astrid","tagline":"Python implementation of NJst","body":"# ASTRID\r\n\r\nASTRID is a ILS-aware tool for species tree estimation. \r\n\r\n## How ASTRID works\r\n\r\nASTRID runs in two phases:\r\n\r\n1. a distance matrix is computed from the input gene trees\r\n2. a distance-based method is used to compute a species tree from the distance matrix\r\n\r\n## Installing ASTRID\r\n\r\nTo install ASTRID, clone the github repository or download it from the links at left. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, whatever distance method you want to use must be installed on your computer. Currently, ASTRID supports FastME and PhyD*. \r\n\r\n### FastME\r\nResults presented in the ASTRID paper use FASTME 1, available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Desper/FastME.html, but FASTME 2.0 is now available at http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/fastme/binaries.php, and works with ASTRID as well. In either case, FastME must be on the PATH with binary name `fastme'. \r\n \r\n### PhyD*\r\nPhyD* is available at http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyd/binaries.php. It implements four algorithms: MVR*, BioNJ*, NJ*, and UNJ*. These methods are recommended for incomplete distance matrices. PhyD* must be on the PATH with binary name `phydstar'.\r\n\r\n## Running ASTRID\r\n\r\nASTRID is run with the following command line arguments:\r\n\r\n    python astrid.py <methodname> <genetrees> <outputtree> [<distancematrix>]\r\n\r\n* methodname is one of \"bionj\", \"mvr\", \"nj\", \"unj\", or \"fastme\", depending on which method you would like to use. FastME is recommended when the distance matrix has no missing entries, and BioNJ is recommended if there are missing entries.\r\n* genetrees is a file containing a list of gene trees in newick format.\r\n* outputtree will contain the estimated species tree\r\n* distancematrix is an optional argument specifying a place to save the distance matrix in PHYLIP format. This is useful if you would like to run multiple distance-based methods on the same gene tree set. If this file already exists, ASTRID will skip the matrix generation step and just run the species tree estimation step with the method specified.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
