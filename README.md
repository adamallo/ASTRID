# Installation

To install the most recent stable version of ASTRID, run (as root)

      pip install astrid-phylo
      
or, to install the development version from Git, run

      pip install git+https://github.com/pranjalv123/ASTRID/

(you should have installed setuptools, numpy, dendropy, and a C++ compiler)

You can also install the most recent version from github by cloning the repository, then running (as root)

      python setup.py install 
      
To install locally (for example, if you're running on a server where you don't have root access), you can do

      pip install astrid-phylo --user
      
or 

      python setup.py install --user
      

# Usage

      ASTRID [-h] -i INPUT [-o OUTPUT] [-m METHOD] [-c CACHE]

ASTRID: Accurate Species TRees from Internode Distances.

optional arguments:

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT:
                        File containing gene trees as newick strings
                        
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT:
                        Output file for species tree
                        
  -m METHOD, --method METHOD:
                        Distance-based method to use (default: fastme if the
                        distance matrix is complete, bionj otherwise
                        
  -c CACHE, --cache CACHE:
                        Save distance matrix in PHYLIP format, or use cached
                        matrix if it exists (useful for trying multiple
                        distance-based methods)

ASTRID is also easy to use from within Python:

    import dendropy
    import ASTRID
    tl = dendropy.TreeList.get_from_path('test/song_mammals.424.gene.tre', 'newick')
    a = ASTRID.ASTRID(tl)
    a.run('auto')
    print str(a.tree)
